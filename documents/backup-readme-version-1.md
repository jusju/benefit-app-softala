## 1. Introduction


**What is Benefit application and what is it's main purpose?**

Benefit application is a project by FisMA ry 2025. It is a software size mesurement program, 
that will calculate function points of navigation and query, interfaces to/from other,

**Why only one repository for the project?**

Our team decided to have only one repository for the project on 24th January 2025.

Majority of the team justified the decision, as it is much easier
to find essential files and data from one and only repository.
Having two or more repository makes the finding of files very troublesome,
and in some case can even cause merging problems in Github.

## 2. Algorithm

The mathematical algorithm has the following logic...

## 3. Tools

We have used following tools in the project:

* Docker, due it will automatically install required languages and libraries 
(e.g. PostgreSQL) for the new member.

Thus it will save both time and hussle for future groups.  

* PostgreSQL for the database. Everyone of our team has used SQL for databases. 
Thus production will be most effective, when we are working with familiar language.

We used PostgreSQL over other SQL DBMS as product owner's wishes.

## 7. CD/CI

The CD/CI pipeline is following:

a) MVP and KISS. In the first sprints (i.e. from Sprint 01 to ...),
our product owner required our team to keep Benefit application simple as possible
in every development.

Thus we developed a very basic calculator (MVP), that only calulates one row of elements.

b) More...
