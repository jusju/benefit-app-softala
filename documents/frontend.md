# Benefit App frontend

## 1. Instructions for setting frontend up locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/fisma-benefit-app/benefit-app.git
    ```

2. Setup and run the spring boot backend (see backend documentation).

3. Navigate to frontend project root which is {project directory}/frontend

4. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

5. Setup environment variables:
    1. Create a file called .env to the frontend project root.
    2. Add the following environment variable: VITE_API_URL. Its value should match the locally running backend development server URL e.g. VITE_API_URL = http://localhost:8080

6. Start the frontend development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
